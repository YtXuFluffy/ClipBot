App Name: ClipBot
Description: ClipBot is a Windows-based application designed to automatically type out the content copied to your clipboard, simulating human-like typing. It can be used to quickly and efficiently "type out" any text that you have copied, such as paragraphs, code snippets, or other content, at a speed that mimics real human typing behavior. The application provides an intuitive and modern GUI, with adjustable settings for typing speed and control over starting and pausing the typing process using hotkeys (F2 to start and F4 to pause).

ClipBot is built using Python, and it combines various libraries such as pyautogui, keyboard, pyperclip, and tkinter to facilitate clipboard access, simulate key presses, and provide a user-friendly interface. It's perfect for automating text input, whether you're testing, demoing, or just need to speed up repetitive typing tasks.

Features:
Clipboard Integration:

ClipBot can directly read the content from your clipboard and type it into any open text field or editor.

Human-Like Typing Simulation:

ClipBot simulates the natural delays and behavior of human typing to make the text entry look realistic. It mimics pauses between keystrokes and even handles line breaks with the Enter key.

Adjustable Typing Speed:

You can adjust the typing speed (in words per minute, WPM) directly from the GUI, making it flexible for various typing preferences.

Pause/Resume Typing:

If you want to pause the typing process, you can easily press F4 or click "Pause Typing" in the GUI. Press F2 to resume typing from where it left off.

Hotkeys:

Hotkeys (F2 to start typing and F4 to pause typing) allow for quick control without having to touch the GUI.

Simple and Modern GUI:

The application provides a clean, dark-themed interface built with Tkinter, allowing users to easily adjust settings and control the app without needing to use the command line.

Text Input from Clipboard:

Simply copy the text you want to type, and ClipBot will take care of typing it out for you.

Key Libraries Used:
pyautogui:

This library is used for simulating keyboard actions. It's responsible for actually typing the content from the clipboard into the active window.

keyboard:

keyboard is used to listen for keyboard events such as pressing the F2 and F4 hotkeys. This allows users to control the typing process efficiently.

pyperclip:

This library allows ClipBot to access the clipboard content, making it possible to retrieve the text that youâ€™ve copied.

time and random:

These are used to simulate delays between keypresses, making the typing feel more human-like.

tkinter:

tkinter is used to create the graphical user interface (GUI). This library provides an easy way to build windows, buttons, labels, and text entry fields.

How the Code Works:
GUI Creation:

The program starts by setting up a Tkinter window, creating buttons and labels for user interaction. The interface allows users to adjust the typing speed, start and pause typing, and exit the app.

Clipboard Reading:

Once the user presses F2 or clicks "Start Typing," ClipBot grabs the clipboard content using pyperclip.paste() and starts simulating typing.

Typing Simulation:

Each character from the clipboard is typed out using pyautogui.write(), and random delays are introduced between each key press to make the typing look natural.

Adjustable Typing Speed:

The typing speed is determined by the words per minute (WPM) that the user enters in the GUI. This is converted to characters per second and applied to control the delays between key presses.

Pause and Resume:

The typing can be paused at any point by pressing F4 or by clicking the "Pause Typing" button. The typing process resumes when F2 is pressed again.

Exit Functionality:

The user can exit the application by clicking the "Quit" button or closing the GUI window.

How to Use ClipBot:
Start Typing:

Copy the text you want to be typed out to the clipboard.

Launch ClipBot and press F2 or click "Start Typing" to begin the typing process.

Pause/Resume Typing:

Press F4 to pause typing at any point. Press F2 again to resume.

Adjust Typing Speed:

Change the typing speed in the input field and hit Enter. The new speed will take effect immediately.

Exit the Application:

Click the "Quit" button or close the window to stop the program.

Future Improvements:
Customization Options:

Allow the user to change the font, color scheme, or theme of the app for a more personalized experience.

Text Filtering:

Add the ability to filter or edit the clipboard content before it's typed out (e.g., remove extra spaces, special characters, or format text).

Support for Multiple Clipboard Entries:

Allow users to store and select from multiple clipboard items to type different content automatically.
